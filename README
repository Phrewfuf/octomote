RC-Remote

A spontaneous Project about building a custom RC-Remote.
Already contains four (yes 4) analog joysticks.
More controls in form of potentiometers and toggle-switches
are planned.

Misusing atmega16-16m (44-pin QFN package) as A/D-Converters with I2C/SPI interface
as i've got a buttload of those laying around with no use.
